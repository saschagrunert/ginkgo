/*
	If a container marked as focus has a descendant that is also marked as focus, Ginkgo's policy is to
	unmark the container's focus.  This gives developers a more intuitive experience when debugging specs.
	It is common to focus a container to just run a subset of specs, then identify the specific specs within the container to focus -
	this policy allows the developer to simply focus those specific specs and not need to go back and turn the focus off of the container:

	As a common example, consider:

		FDescribe("something to debug", function() {
			It("works", function() {...})
			It("works", function() {...})
			FIt("doesn't work", function() {...})
			It("works", function() {...})
		})

	here the developer's intent is to focus in on the `"doesn't work"` spec and not to run the adjacent specs in the focused `"something to debug"`Â container.
	The nested policy applied by this function enables this behavior.

	Ginkgo supports focussing specs using `FIt`, `FDescribe`, etc. - this is called "programmatic focus"
	It also supports focussing specs using regular expressions on the command line (`-focus=`, `-skip=`).
	The CLI regular expressions take precedence.

	This function sets the `Skip` property on specs by applying Ginkgo's focus policy:
	- If there are no CLI arguments and no programmatic focus, do nothing.
	- If there are no CLi arguments but a spec somewhere has programmatic focus, skip any specs that have no programmatic focus.
	- If there are CLI arguments parse them and skip any specs that either don't match the filter regexp or do match* the skip regexp.

	Lastly, `config.RegexScansFilePath` allows the regular exprressions to match against the spec's filepath as well as the spec's text.

	*Note:* specs with pending nodes are Skipped when created by NewSpec.
